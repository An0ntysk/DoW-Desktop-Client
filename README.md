Did you ever had a moment, where you wanted to move some music,
images or other files onto your phone, but the USB cable is on
the other side of the room? And even if you move and get it, moving
doesn't always work? Well, you *could* use BlueTooth, but not

copy, connect to another device and wait the program to do its work

## DISCLAIMER

For now, this version is merely a prototype, not much functionality
has been implemented and I haven't even started the Android version yet
